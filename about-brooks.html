<p style="font-size:14px;padding-bottom:-5px">Brooks Co-op – which opened its doors in 2001 – is a 14-member co-op conveniently located halfway between the University of Illinois campus and downtown Urbana (about a 10-minute walk to each). Each week, our members eat five meals together, perform household chores, and enjoy each other’s company in a friendly atmosphere. Our house has 14 bedrooms, 1½ kitchens, a dining room, 2 living rooms, five bathrooms and a basement.</p>

								<h2>About the House</h2>
								<h4>Bedrooms</h4>
								<p style="font-size:16px">Brooks has 14 bedrooms, which are usually used as singles. Double occupancy is permitted in larger rooms.<br>Room rates for 2019-2020 vary from $320 to $493 per month, depending on room size and its aesthetic condition.<br>Utilities and food are extra (about $50 and $145 respectively).</p>
								<h4>Food</h4>
								<p style="font-size:16px">Brooks’ members enjoy five weekly house meals; members take turns cooking for each other. The co-op offers mostly healthy vegetarian meals with occasional non-vegetarian dishes as well. The house also buys its own food (which is decided by its members), although members are allowed to buy their own personal food.</p>
								<h4>Amenities</h4>
								<p style="font-size:16px">Our house is equipped with wireless internet and there is access to wired internet connection in almost every room. The house does not have a land phone; most house members bring their own cell phone. There is a washer and dryer in the basement, and a big compost bin in the back yard for vegetable waste.</p>
								<h4>Labor and Decision Making</h4>
								<p style="font-size:16px">Keeping the house in good working order is an important part of life at Brooks. Each member cooks, cleans after meals, and does weekly chores - like cleaning bathrooms, washing the dining room floor, and taking out the garbage. Some members also take on coordinator positions. These people are responsible for house finances, maintenance, food shopping, membership, and labor coordination. Once a semester, we dedicate an entire day making improvements to our house. Check out the FAQs for more details. Decisions are voted on and decided by modified consensus (all in agreement, but one) for bigger decisions and simple majority for minor decisions.</p>
								<p style="font-size:16px">House meetings occur once a week, and give members the opportunity to make democratic decisions on how to run the house. The house uses a modified-consensus model in which a proposal can be vetoed by two or more votes. In honor of the house’s namesake, the poet Gwendolyn Brooks, members sometimes read a poem at the beginning of house meetings.</p>
<!-- 								<p style="font-size:16px">House meeting times vary, but are generally held once a week.</p> -->
								<h4>Members</h4>
								<p style="font-size:16px">Brooks’ members include graduate students, undergraduates, and community members from diverse cultural backgrounds. Many housemates become friends and do things together outside of the house.</p>
