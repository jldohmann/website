        <h4 style="padding-top:40px;">Bedrooms</h4>
	    <p>Harvest is a three-story house with a furnished basement. Each floor has a 3/4ths bathroom. There are 14 bedrooms, all are completely furnished with a bed, dresser and desk.<br>The average rent per room is $350 per month, with rates ranging from $300/month to $415/month. Utilities and food together are another $215 per month.</p>
	   
        <h4>Food</h4>
	    <p>Harvesters prepare home-cooked, healthy, vegetarian and vegan-friendly dinners Monday through Friday and on Sunday, and brunch on Saturday. Each person cooks once a week, so teams of two make each meal. We buy food in bulk from UNFI which delivers to the house once a month. We strive to buy local when we can and organic when it is the most sustainable option.</p>
	    
        <h4>Amenities</h4>
	    <p>Common spaces include a large kitchen with industrial-quality appliances, pantry, dining room, living room, laundry room, entertainment room, storage closets, and a garage.</p>
	    <p>We have Ethernet internet connections available and high-speed wifi.</p>
	    <p>We also have a house computer with shared printing, bike rack, and a washer and dryer, all of which are free to use for housemates.</p>
	    
        <h4>Labor and Decision Making</h4>
	    <p>Harvest upholds pretty standard operating procedures for a co-op. Check out the FAQs for more details. We make decisions that affect the house either through email (in urgent or low-stakes cases) or at our house meetings on Sunday nights. Decisions are voted on and decided by modified consensus (all in agreement, but one) for bigger decisions and simple majority for minor decisions.</p>
	    <p>House meetings are usually at 7pm on Mondays, depending on what is most convenient for members..</p>
	    
        <h4>Members</h4>
	    <p>Harvest is open to anyone regardless of occupation or student status! The house is usually a mixture of undergraduate and graduate students and non-student community members. House members come from all corners of the world and encompass a variety of cultural backgrounds.</p>
	    <p>Harvest is committed to diversity. Diversity of experience, backgrounds, ideas, and personalities. When deciding who to vote into the house, we value the perspective a person might contribute to the community as much as we care about the typical criteria, such as ability to pay rent.</p>
