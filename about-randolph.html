				<p>Randolph is a nine bedroom house in Champaign focused on gardening, cooking, and cooperative living. The house previously was operated as the Catholic Worker House and served the homeless population of Champaign, and we aim to honor this history by offering accessible and affordable housing, as well as sharing our food and produce with the community. Randolph is currently leased from Jonah Weisskopf, unlike Brooks and Harvest which are owned by NASCO Properties, which mostly just means house members are not responsible for as much maintenance.</p>
