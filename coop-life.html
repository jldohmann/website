                    <h4>Communal Meals</h4>
					<p>House meals are one of the major aspects of the co-op experience. Housemates take turns cooking for each other, and dinner is often a time for members to socialize with each other.</p>
					<h4>Resource Sharing</h4>
					<p>Living in a cooperative means that there is no need for everyone to own a set of dishes, buy all of their own food, or buy their own cleaning supplies. Money is saved by buying in bulk and resources are conserved by sharing public goods.</p>
					<h4>Shared Labor</h4>
					<p>By setting up an orderly division of labor, housing co-ops make sure that everyone does their part in maintaining the house and no one gets stuck with all the work.</p>
					<h4>Community</h4>
					<p>Roommates may merely co-exist without actually interacting with each other. Housing co-op members establish community by working together.</p>
